Math quiz/training for grade 1 (elementary school)

This program came into being when my daughter started pre-school earlier this year. Now she's 6 years old and is attending grade 1. Consequently the program has been extended by several new exercises, all as per material she has been learning in school.

The program now contains 5 arithmetic exercises; +/- (in 3 levels), multiplication/division  table (adjustable from 5x5 to 12x12), 3 digit multiplication and division. 

There are also 7 non arithmetic exercises; (Before, Between, After), (Odd, Even), Position Value, (>, =, <), Sequence (3 levels), Fractions, and Clock.

All of those (except multiplication and division, which she has not learned yet), have been of great help to my daughter. She especially likes non arithmetic ones :-)

Program is very simple to operate, and very easy for parent to control later what was the child up to. Each exercise set (min 10, max 30 exercises) is allotted certain amount of time, and when exercises are completed, if time was exceeded, penalty (again certain number of exercises) is given. After that if there were any mistakes, again additional exercises are given.

Child very quickly learns that accuracy,  and speed are important.

Program keeps the record of all exercises, and child's answers, black for correct answers, and red for errors.

Program has been extensively tested (by my daughter Jasna) for the past 3 months. She has been using it almost every day for 30-45 minutes daily.
